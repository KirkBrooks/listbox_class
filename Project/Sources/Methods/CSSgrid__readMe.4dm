/*  Another take on creating a listbox with html
This time we use CSS Grid

The basic idea is each element of the listbox is a CSS grid defining the
columns a property is in. 

The listbox itself is a grid of rows.

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH
 - each listbox row can have multiple rows of data
 - a column can span more than one row
 - reactive
